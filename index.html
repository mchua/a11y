<p>Hello -- you're probably at this page because you want to know how to make something accessible to me as a Deaf person. I've written a more general <a href="https://adacamp.org/adacamp-toolkit/supporting-deaf-people/">primer on event access for d/Deaf and hard-of-hearing (DHH) people</a>, and the first big point is that everyone is different, and you should ask each individual DHH person what they need. For me specifically, though -- here's how I'd answer that.</p>

<h2>
<a name="written-documentation" class="anchor" href="#written-documentation"><span class="octicon octicon-link"></span></a>Written documentation</h2>

<p>Schedules/notes/documentation/papers in written form whenever they are available. Interpreters and captioners will need them for prep as well, so please pass those on!</p>

<h2>
<a name="asl-american-sign-language-interpretation" class="anchor" href="#asl-american-sign-language-interpretation"><span class="octicon octicon-link"></span></a>ASL (American Sign Language) interpretation</h2>

<p>I prefer ASL (American Sign Language) interpreting as a main form of access. I'll need an interpreting team for the duration of the conference, including evening networking events; teams of two or more will rotate periodically in order to prevent fatigue from affecting interpreting quality. Not all interpreters can handle all scenarios, and I tend to get involved in complex, doctoral-level discussions in multiple fields -- so make sure the interpreting team can handle this level of event. I may be able to connect you to either locals who are well qualified, or interpreters who've worked with me in the past and can fly in for a high-level event.</p>

<p>Interpreters and interpreting agencies tend to want my <a href="https://github.com/mchua/a11y/blob/gh-pages/terpteamprep.md">interpreter prep letter.</a></p>

<h2>
<a name="cart-realtime-transcription" class="anchor" href="#cart-realtime-transcription"><span class="octicon octicon-link"></span></a>CART (realtime transcription)</h2>

<p>If ASL interpreting is not an option at all times, in-person CART (realtime stenographic trancription) may be an acceptable way for me to access talks, especially keynotes/plenaries. If in-person CART is not available, remote CART with a <a href="http://stenoknight.com/demo.html#cartprojected">projected screen</a> is doable. As a side benefit, other attendees with hearing loss, ADHD (I have this too), dyslexia, auditory processing disorder, and English-language learners will benefit -- and you'll have transcripts of the keynotes/plenaries immediately afterwards.</p>

<p>Stenographers and captioning agencies tend to want my <a href="https://github.com/mchua/a11y/blob/gh-pages/cartteamprep.md">captioner prep letter.</a></p>

<h2>
<a name="tips-on-requesting" class="anchor" href="#tips-on-requesting"><span class="octicon octicon-link"></span></a>For other DHH folks: tips on requesting</h2>

<p>I'm working on making my templates for access requests into resources that would be useful to others. One early version of this is a breakdown of <a href="https://github.com/mchua/a11y/blob/gh-pages/letter-for-finding-interpreters.md">how I send in a request for interpreting</a> to a new person/event if I want to include a lot of detail. My approach is particular to who I am and the position I'm in, so my letter may or may not work for you -- adapt it to your own situation as needed! </p>

Many thanks to:

<ul>
<li> Teresa Blankmeyer Burke, whose interpreter prep letter became the inspiration for my own</li>
<li> Brittany Ray, who substantially revised an early version of this prep letter so it would be more useful from an ASL interpreter's perspective</li>
<li> Mirabai Knight, who spurred the creation of the first captioning prep letter, and Alex Schneider, who substantially improved it</li>
<li> Ian Smith and Giordon Stark, who were among the first to create similar letters and spread this appproach to a larger audience</li>
</ul>
